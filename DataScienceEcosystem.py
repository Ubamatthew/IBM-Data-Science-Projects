# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ## Introduction

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Scala
# 5. Java
# 6. Visual Basic

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Scientific Computing Libraries. Examples are
#    - Pandas
#    - Numpy
# 2. Visualization Libraries. Examples are
#    - Matplotlib
#    - Seaborn
# 3. Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries. Examples are
#    - Scikit learn
#    - Keras
# 4. Deep Learning Libraries. Examples are
#    - Tensor Flow
#    - PyTouch
# 5. Scalar Libraries. Examples are
#    - Vegas
#    - Big Dl

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[5]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

A=3
B=4
C=5
D=(A*B)+C
print(D)


# In[7]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# Let
Time_in_Minutes = 200
Minutes_in_1_hour = 60

Time_in_Hour = Time_in_Minutes/Minutes_in_1_hour

print (Time_in_Hour)
